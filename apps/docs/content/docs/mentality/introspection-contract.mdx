# Introspection Contract

Introspection is the contract between server definitions and admin rendering.

## Contract goals

- transport metadata as plain serializable objects
- include field types, labels, constraints, admin references
- avoid transporting executable UI logic

## Simplified flow

```text
Server builders
  -> collection/global metadata
  -> introspection payload
  -> client registry resolution
  -> rendered admin UI
```

## Example shape

```ts
{
  collections: {
    pages: {
      fields: {
        title: { type: "text", label: { en: "Title" }, required: true },
      },
      admin: {
        icon: { type: "icon", props: { name: "ph:article" } },
      },
      list: { view: "table", config: {} },
      form: { view: "form", config: {} },
    },
  },
}
```

## Client responsibility

- resolve `view` ids via view registry
- resolve `{ type, props }` component references via component registry
- resolve field type renderers via field registry

## Common mistake

Assuming only built-in view/component names exist. Treat all names as registry-resolved.
