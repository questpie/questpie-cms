# TanStack Barbershop Admin Tour

## Client builder

- `examples/tanstack-barbershop/src/questpie/admin/builder.ts`

`qa<AppCMS>().use(adminModule)` provides typed client registries.

## Final admin config

- `examples/tanstack-barbershop/src/questpie/admin/admin.ts`

Shows minimal client responsibility:

- locale support
- registry usage from module

## Key takeaway

Most admin structure is server-defined. Client remains focused on rendering layer behavior.
