# Examples

Examples serve as executable architecture documentation. The TanStack Barbershop is the primary reference — a complete booking system built with QUESTPIE that demonstrates collections, relations, reactive fields, RPC, jobs, and admin configuration.

## TanStack Barbershop

A full-stack barbershop booking system built with TanStack Start, demonstrating real-world usage of every major QUESTPIE feature.

**What it covers:**
- 7 collections (barbers, services, appointments, pages, reviews, and more)
- Many-to-many relations (barber ↔ services)
- Reactive fields (cancellation UI)
- RPC functions (slot availability, booking creation)
- Background jobs (email confirmations)
- Block-based pages with preview
- Dashboard widgets and sidebar configuration
- Full admin panel with filters, saved views, and bulk actions
