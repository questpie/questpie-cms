# Migration

This section helps you move from older QUESTPIE patterns to the current server-first architecture. The core change is moving admin configuration from the client to the server — the server now declares what the admin should display, and the client resolves it through registries.

## What Changed

The key architectural shift:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Admin config defined in client code | Admin config defined on server collections/globals |
| RPC functions scattered across files | RPC routers with typed schemas |
| Form visibility logic in React components | Reactive field system (hidden, readOnly, compute) |
| Client imports server types directly | Client receives introspection data at runtime |

## Migration Guides

- [Admin Config Migration](/docs/migration/old-admin-config-to-server-config) — Move `.admin()`, `.list()`, and `.form()` config from client to server collection builders
- [RPC Migration](/docs/migration/old-rpc-to-new-rpc) — Convert old function patterns to `rpc().router()` contracts with Zod schemas
- [Form Migration](/docs/migration/old-form-config-to-reactive-system) — Replace ad-hoc UI logic with server-defined reactive field handlers

## General Strategy

1. **Start with the server** — Move admin config to collection/global builders first. The server is the source of truth.
2. **Update the client** — Replace custom client-side logic with `qa().use(adminModule)`. Most rendering happens automatically through registries.
3. **Migrate incrementally** — You don't need to migrate everything at once. The system supports mixed patterns during transition.
