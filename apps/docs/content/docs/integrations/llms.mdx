QUESTPIE CMS documentation supports AI-friendly formats that make it easier for large language models to read and understand the documentation.

## Available Endpoints

### `/llms-full.txt`

A complete version of all documentation pages in a single text file, optimized for AI consumption.

```
https://questpie.com/llms-full.txt
```

This endpoint returns all documentation pages concatenated together with their titles and URLs. It's useful for:

- Training or fine-tuning AI models on QUESTPIE CMS documentation
- Providing context to AI assistants about the CMS
- Building RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems

### `*.mdx` Extension

You can get any documentation page as Markdown by appending `.mdx` to the URL path.

**Example:**

```
# Original page
https://questpie.com/docs/introduction/overview

# Markdown version
https://questpie.com/docs/introduction/overview.mdx
```

This is useful for:

- AI agents that need to read specific documentation pages
- Tools that prefer Markdown format over HTML
- Building documentation pipelines

## Using with AI Assistants

### Claude

When using Claude or similar AI assistants, you can reference the documentation:

```
Please read the QUESTPIE CMS documentation at:
https://questpie.com/docs/core-concepts/collections.mdx

And help me create a new collection for blog posts.
```

### ChatGPT / Custom GPTs

You can configure custom GPTs to use the `/llms-full.txt` endpoint as a knowledge source for answering questions about QUESTPIE CMS.

### RAG Systems

For RAG implementations, you can:

1. Fetch `/llms-full.txt` periodically
2. Split into chunks and create embeddings
3. Store in a vector database
4. Query relevant chunks when users ask questions

## Response Format

### llms-full.txt

Each page in the full text export follows this format:

```markdown
# Page Title (/docs/path/to/page)

Page content in processed Markdown format...
```

Pages are separated by double newlines.

### Individual Pages (*.mdx)

Individual pages return the same format:

```markdown
# Page Title (/docs/path/to/page)

Page content in processed Markdown format...
```

## Caching

Both endpoints are cached for optimal performance:

- **CDN cache**: 24 hours (`s-maxage=86400`)
- **Browser cache**: 1 hour (`max-age=3600`)
- **Stale-while-revalidate**: 7 days

This means AI systems can fetch the documentation frequently without overwhelming the server.
