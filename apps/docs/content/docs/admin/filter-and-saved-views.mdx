# Filters & Saved Views

The admin table view includes a filter builder for constructing complex queries, column visibility controls, and saved views that persist filter/sort/column configurations as named presets.

## Filter Builder

The filter builder opens as a side sheet from the table view toolbar. It provides a visual interface for constructing filters with operators specific to each field type.

### Adding Filters

1. Open the filter sheet from the table toolbar
2. Select a field to filter on
3. Choose an operator (equals, contains, greater than, etc.)
4. Set the filter value
5. Add more filters as needed (combined with AND)

### Available Operators

Operators vary by field type:

| Field Type | Operators |
|---|---|
| Text | equals, not equals, contains, starts with, ends with, is empty |
| Number | equals, not equals, greater than, less than, between |
| Date | equals, before, after, between, is empty |
| Select | equals, not equals, in, not in |
| Boolean | is true, is false |
| Relation | equals (record ID), is empty |

## Column Configuration

The filter sheet includes a columns tab for managing visible columns:

- **Show/hide columns** — Toggle column visibility
- **Reorder columns** — Drag to rearrange column order
- **Reset to defaults** — Restore the collection's default column configuration

## Saved Views

Save the current filter, sort, and column configuration as a named view:

```text
Current state: filters + sort + visible columns → Save as "Published Posts"
```

### Creating a Saved View

1. Set up your desired filters, sort order, and column visibility
2. Open the filter sheet
3. Switch to the "Saved Views" tab
4. Enter a name and save

### Loading a Saved View

Select a saved view from the dropdown to restore its complete configuration — filters, sort, and columns are all applied at once.

### Managing Saved Views

- **Save** — Persist current filter/sort/column config
- **Load** — Restore a saved configuration
- **Delete** — Remove a saved view

Saved views are stored per collection via the admin preferences API.

## View Configuration

The saved view system stores:

```ts
interface ViewConfiguration {
  filters: FilterItem[];           // Active filters
  sortConfig: SortConfig | null;   // Sort column and direction
  visibleColumns: string[];        // Visible column field names
}
```

## Server-Side Integration

The filter builder generates query parameters that map to the collection's CRUD API. Filters are translated to `where` clauses:

```ts
// Filter: status equals "published"
// Generates:
{ where: { status: "published" } }

// Filter: createdAt after 2024-01-01
// Generates:
{ where: { createdAt: { $gt: "2024-01-01" } } }
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Non-filterable fields** — Some field types (richText, blocks, json) may not support all filter operators. The filter builder only shows applicable operators per field type.
- **Saved views not syncing** — Saved views are per-user, per-collection. They don't sync across users. For shared presets, define default filters in the collection's `.list()` configuration.
