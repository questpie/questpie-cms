# Admin Overview

The QUESTPIE admin panel is a React application that renders collections, globals, dashboards, and custom pages based on server-defined contracts. The server defines **what** to show (fields, views, actions); the client defines **how** to render it (components, styling, layout).

## Why This Architecture

Traditional CMSes couple the admin UI to specific field implementations. QUESTPIE separates concerns: the server emits a serializable introspection payload, and the client resolves it through registries. This means you can swap renderers, customize the design system, or add entirely new field types without modifying the server.

## Two-Layer Setup

### Server — `@questpie/admin/server`

Adds admin capabilities to your `q` builder: sidebar config, dashboard widgets, collection admin settings, and the introspection endpoint.

```ts
import { q } from "questpie";
import { adminModule } from "@questpie/admin/server";

const cms = q({ name: "app" })
  .use(adminModule)
  .collections({ posts, barbers, services })
  .sidebar(({ s }) =>
    s.sidebar({
      sections: [
        { label: "Content", items: [s.collection("posts"), s.collection("barbers")] },
        { label: "Config", items: [s.global("siteSettings")] },
      ],
    }),
  )
  .dashboard(({ d }) =>
    d.dashboard({
      items: [
        d.stats({ collection: "posts", label: "Total Posts" }),
        d.recentItems({ collection: "barbers", limit: 5 }),
      ],
    }),
  )
  .build({ db: { url: process.env.DATABASE_URL } });
```

### Client — `@questpie/admin/client`

Builds the admin configuration: registries for fields, views, components, and widgets, plus branding and locale settings.

```ts
import { qa, coreAdminModule } from "@questpie/admin/client";
import type { AppCMS } from "../server/cms";

export const admin = qa<AppCMS>()
  .use(coreAdminModule)
  .config({
    branding: { name: "Barbershop Admin" },
    locale: { default: "en", supported: ["en", "de", "sk"] },
  });
```

## How Rendering Works

```text
Server introspection payload
  → field type IDs (e.g., "text", "relation", "blocks")
  → view IDs (e.g., "table", "form")
  → component refs (e.g., { type: "icon", props: { name: "ph:users" } })

Client registries
  → resolve IDs to React components
  → render with server-provided config + props
```

The admin router fetches the introspection payload for each collection/global and renders the appropriate views using registered components.

## Key Concepts

- **Registries** — Map type IDs to React components. Four registries: fields, views, components, widgets.
- **Introspection** — Server emits JSON describing each collection's fields, views, actions, and admin config. The admin fetches this on mount.
- **Server-first config** — Collections own their sidebar position, dashboard widgets, list columns, and form layout. The client only handles rendering.
- **Extensibility** — Add custom field renderers, views, or widgets by registering them in the `qa()` builder.
