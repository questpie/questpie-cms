# Design System Integration

QUESTPIE ships contracts, not a forced visual identity. The admin UI is built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and Tailwind CSS, but every rendering layer is extensible through registries. You can replace field components, views, icons, and theme tokens while keeping the type-safe server contracts.

## Why This Exists

Organizations have their own design systems, brand colors, and UI conventions. The registry pattern lets you override any admin component while preserving the introspection contract between server and client.

## Integration Points

### 1. Custom Field Renderers

Replace how individual field types render in forms and table cells:

```ts
const admin = qa<AppCMS>()
  .use(coreAdminModule)
  .fields({
    text: {
      name: "text",
      kind: "field",
      createField: (config) => MyBrandTextField,
      createCell: (config) => MyBrandTextCell,
    },
  });
```

See [Field Renderer Registry](/docs/admin/field-renderer-registry).

### 2. Custom Views

Replace the entire list or form view with your own implementation:

```ts
.views({
  kanban: {
    name: "kanban",
    kind: "listView",
    component: MyKanbanView,
  },
})
```

See [View Registry](/docs/admin/view-registry-list-and-form).

### 3. Component Registry Overrides

Replace the icon or badge components with your design system's equivalents:

```ts
.components({
  icon: MyDesignSystemIcon,
  badge: MyDesignSystemBadge,
})
```

See [Component Registry](/docs/admin/component-registry).

### 4. Theming

The admin uses CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, and typography. Override them in your CSS:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 262 80% 50%;
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
  --radius: 0.5rem;
  --font-sans: "Inter", sans-serif;
}
```

The admin's stylesheet is built on shadcn/ui conventions — see their [theming docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) for the full list of CSS variables.

### 5. Branding

Set admin branding on the server builder:

```ts
const cms = q({ name: "app" })
  .use(adminModule)
  .branding({
    name: { en: "My Brand" },
    logo: "/logo.svg",
  });
```

See [Dashboard, Sidebar & Branding](/docs/admin/dashboard-sidebar-branding).

## Best Practices

1. **Keep server contracts serializable** — Don't put React components or functions in server config. Use component references.
2. **Register custom renderers in `qa()`** — All visual customization goes through the admin builder.
3. **Test across viewports** — The admin supports desktop and mobile layouts. Test custom components in both.
4. **Respect the field config props** — Custom renderers should handle `readOnly`, `disabled`, `hidden`, `required`, and `localized` consistently.

## Common Mistakes

- **Modifying shadcn/ui source directly** — Override via CSS variables or registry replacements, not by patching the source files.
- **Breaking the contract** — Custom field renderers must still read from `value` and write via `onChange`. The form state management expects this contract.
- **Ignoring dark mode** — The admin supports light and dark modes via shadcn/ui. Custom components should respect the `dark` class.
