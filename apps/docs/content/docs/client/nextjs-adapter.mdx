# Next.js Adapter

The Next.js adapter generates route handlers for the App Router's catch-all route pattern. All CMS endpoints are handled by a single `[...slug]` route.

## Server Setup

```ts
// app/api/cms/[...slug]/route.ts
import { questpieNextRouteHandlers } from "@questpie/next";
import { cms, appRpc } from "@/questpie/cms";

export const { GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD } =
  questpieNextRouteHandlers(cms, {
    basePath: "/api/cms",
    rpc: appRpc,
  });
```

### `questpieNextRouteHandlers(cms, config)`

Returns an object with HTTP method handlers (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `PUT`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`) suitable for Next.js route handler exports.

### Alternative: Single Handler

For more control, use `questpieNext` which returns a single request handler:

```ts
import { questpieNext } from "@questpie/next";

const handler = questpieNext(cms, {
  basePath: "/api/cms",
  rpc: appRpc,
});

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return handler(request);
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  return handler(request);
}

// ... etc
```

## Client Setup

Next.js doesn't have a framework-specific typed client. Use the core `createClient`:

```ts
import { createClient } from "questpie/client";
import type { AppCMS } from "@/questpie/cms";

const client = createClient<AppCMS>({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
  basePath: "/api/cms",
});

// Collections
const posts = await client.collections.posts.find({ limit: 10 });

// Globals
const settings = await client.globals.siteSettings.get();
```

### With TanStack Query

```ts
import { createQuestpieQueryOptions } from "@questpie/tanstack-query";

const cms = createQuestpieQueryOptions(client);

// In a component
const { data } = useQuery(cms.collections.posts.find({ limit: 10 }));
```

## Configuration

The adapter configuration is the same as `createFetchHandler` — see [Adapters Overview](/docs/client/adapters-overview).

## File Structure

```
app/
  api/
    cms/
      [...slug]/
        route.ts    ← All CMS routes handled here
  questpie/
    cms.ts          ← CMS builder and config
    client.ts       ← Client instance
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Wrong route path** — The catch-all route must be at `app/api/cms/[...slug]/route.ts` (matching the `basePath`). If `basePath` is `/api/cms`, the file must be at that path.
- **Missing method exports** — Export all HTTP methods. If you only export `GET` and `POST`, PATCH and DELETE requests will 405.
- **Server-side vs client-side** — The `createClient` call should use a full URL. For server components, use the server's internal URL; for client components, use the public URL.
