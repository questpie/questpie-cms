/**
 * Builder Extension Proxy Wrapper
 *
 * Generic Proxy wrapper that intercepts extension method calls on builders
 * (CollectionBuilder, GlobalBuilder) and delegates to `builder.set()`.
 * Re-wraps builder-returning methods so the Proxy chain is preserved
 * across immutable builder calls.
 *
 * Previously emitted inline in every generated factories.ts — now a single
 * importable utility.
 *
 * @see RFC-CONTEXT-FIRST §6 (Extension System Without Monkey-Patching)

 * and delegated to `builder.set(stateKey, resolve(config))`. Core builder
 * methods (e.g. `.fields()`, `.hooks()`) are passed through, and if they
 * return a builder instance, the result is re-wrapped to preserve the chain.
 *

 * @param registry - Map of extension method names to their config
