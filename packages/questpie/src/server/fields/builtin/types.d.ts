/**
 * Built-in Fields Type Augmentation
 *
 * NOTE: Module augmentation is no longer used.
 * Field types are now derived from questpie.state.fields at compile time.
 *
 * This file is kept for backwards compatibility but does nothing.
 * See builder.ts for DefaultFieldTypeMap which is now a type alias to DefaultFields.
